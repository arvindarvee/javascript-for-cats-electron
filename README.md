# JavaScript for Cats on Electron

This is a fork of @maxogden's :cat2: [JS for Cats](http://github.com/maxogden/javascript-for-cats) :computer: project but with all the content in [Electron](http://electron.atom.io). It looks exactly the same :laughing:.

## Why?

Because I realized it could be done really fast. And isn't it funny that the cool part of JS for Cats was using the browser to teach JavaScript and Electron is also like a browser and so your whole learn-dev environment can pop open :boom: even when you're on a :airplane: or :steam_locomotive: with no :signal_strength:.

:ok_woman: Do what I want!
